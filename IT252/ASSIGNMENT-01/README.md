# Assignment 01: Python Basics

This assignment consists of 5 basic Python problems. For each problem, you are required to write a Python function and include a unit test within the same file to verify your solution.

## Problems

1. **Sum of Two Numbers**
   - Write a function that takes two numbers and returns their sum.
   - Test: Check the sum of 2 and 3 is 5.

2. **Even or Odd**
   - Write a function that determines if a number is even or odd.
   - Test: Check that 4 is even and 5 is odd.

3. **Largest of Three Numbers**
   - Write a function that returns the largest of three numbers.
   - Test: Check the largest of 3, 7, and 5 is 7.

4. **Reverse a String**
   - Write a function that reverses a given string.
   - Test: Check that 'hello' becomes 'olleh'.

5. **Factorial Calculation**
   - Write a function that calculates the factorial of a number.
   - Test: Check that the factorial of 5 is 120.

## Instructions

- For each problem, create a Python file named `problemX_<description>.py` (e.g., `problem1_sum.py`).
- Each file must contain:
  - The function implementation.
  - A unit test using Python's `unittest` framework.
- Run the file to execute the test and verify your solution.
